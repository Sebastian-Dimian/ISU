## FLOW GAME

### Purpose of the project is too create a game where there are 4 diferent colours, each colour has their own point on a 5 by 5 grid, the goal is to connect each colour to its other own colour point without interfering with other colours 

### goal is to be finished the game by June, along with a video explanation.

### I will use Pygame to complete the project

# Above was my orginal idea, however it has now changed to a visual text-based adventrue game
